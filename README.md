# Moonway
The first map, 'Moonway,' is an advanced map where you can see sometimes a kind of rocket. 

# ShellShock
The second map, an expert one named 'Shellshock,' allows you to pop Bloons with a simple left click on your mouse. Additionally, you gain +1 damage for every $5,000 (in sale value) by your military monkeys, and your pierce is tripled for each Churchill present on the map
