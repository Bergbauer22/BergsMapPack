The second map, an expert one named 'Shellshock,' allows you to pop Bloons with a simple left click on your mouse. Additionally, you gain +1 damage for every $5,000 (in sale value) by your military monkeys, and your pierce is tripled for each Churchill present on the map   Credits to Timotheeee for his MapEditor";
